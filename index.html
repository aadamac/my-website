            Artificial intelligence presents a <q>vast potential</q> for rejuvenating UK public services, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday.
        </p>
        <p>
            The AI Opportunities Action Plan is backed by leading tech firms, some of which have committed Â£14bn towards various projects, creating 13,250 jobs, the government said.
            <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04nl711r0qo"><b>But the government faces questions</b></a>
            over how much time and money will be needed to make its vision a reality, amid 
            <b><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c897vw5w7p8o">concerns over borrowing costs and the falling value of the pound.</a></b>
        </p>
        <h2>How the AI Plan Could Affect You</h2>
        <ol>
            <ul>AI will be used by the public sector to enable its workers to spend less time doing admin and more time delivering service</ul>
            <ul>Several <q>AI Growth Zones</q> around the UK will be created, involving big building projects and new jobs.</ul>
            <ul>AI will be fed through cameras around the country to inspect roads and spot potholes that need fixing</ul>
            <ul>Teachers and small business owners were highlighted as two groups that could start using AI for things like faster planning and record-keeping.</ul>
            <ul>AI is already being used in UK hospitals for important tasks such as diagnosing cancer more quickly and it will continue to be used to support the NHS.</ul>
        </ol>
